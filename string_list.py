    'Stibbons imagined wizards to be powerful demi-gods who could change the world at the flick of a finger. Then he\'d grown up and found that they were old men worried about the state of their feet and, in harm\'s way, would bicker about the origin of the phrase "in harm\'s way."', 
    '"I can\'t help thinking that we may have tinkered with the past." said Senior Wrangler. "I don\'t see how," said Ridcully. "The past happened before we got here." "Ye, but now we\'re here, we\'ve changed it." "Then we changed it before." And that, they felt, pretty well summed it up.',
