# Pratchett Quotarator

Contains over 500 pratchett quotes I've highlighted while reading through nearly the entire discworld series.

Displays a random quote on the SSD1306 display; refreshes every several hours.

Can be manually refreshed by pushing the rotary.

Quotes that do not fit on the screen can be scrolled through by turning the rotary.

Running off a rpi pico (h), written in micropython.
